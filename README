This is a duplicate file finder for Windows. A GUI front end (CloneFinderFrontEnd)
is provided for end users, and a class library (CloneFinder) for developers
who need an open source licensed component.

Version 4.0 of the .Net framework is required.

Visual C# 2010 Express (with SP1), NUnit 2.5, and Warsetup 3.13 were used
to build, and test the project.

CloneFinder uses/includes the following third party components:
- Code from MSDN for a breadth-first directory traversal.
- System.Data.SQLite library (v1.0.66 in particular)
- Free or CC licensed artwork. (Icons (C) 2008 GoSquared Ltd.)

Redo the GUI with WPF.
A command line interface.
Write some quick documentation for the class library.
Update System.Data.SQLite to a version that is 4.0 Framework native.
