This is a duplicate file finder for Windows. A GUI front end (CloneFinderFrontEnd)
is provided for end users, and a class library (CloneFinder) for developers
who need an open source licensed component.

Installer (MSI file), or binaries only (ZIP) distributions are provided on the download page.

Version 4.0 of the .Net framework is required.

Visual C# 2010 Express (with SP1), NUnit 2.5, and Warsetup 3.13 were used
to build, and test the project.

CloneFinder uses/includes the following third party components:

- Free or CC licensed artwork.
