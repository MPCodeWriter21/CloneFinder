This is a duplicate file finder for Windows. A GUI front end (CloneFinderFrontEnd)
and shell interface (CloneFinder.exe) is provided for end users, 
and a class library (CloneFinder.dll) for developers
who need an open source licensed (MIT X11 license) component.

Version 4.0 of the .Net framework is required.

Visual C# 2010 Express (with SP1), NUnit 2.5, Warsetup 3.13, and Wix 3.5 were used
to build, and test the project.

CloneFinder uses/includes the following third party components:
- Code from MSDN for a breadth-first directory traversal.
- System.Data.SQLite library (v1.0.66 in particular)
- CommandLine Parser library (v1.8 stable) - http://commandline.codeplex.com/
- Free or CC licensed artwork. (Icons (C) 2008 GoSquared Ltd.)
